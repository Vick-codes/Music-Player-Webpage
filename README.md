# Music-Player-Webpage
A music player webpage for listening to audio/music files directly from the web

# Built with:
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

# My Process
- I designed the nav-bar first giving it a space between the logo and Ul li menu items
- The listen text and play/pause icon was done with the float: right property
- I employed the onclick function in Javascript to enable to song play/pause and changed the icon respectively

# Challenge
My setback was trying to float the text and icon to the right position as float property can be unpredictable sometimes
